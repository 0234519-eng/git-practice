## Teaching Strategy

### For Instructors

**Setup**:
1. Students complete Exercises 1-4 first
2. In Exercise 5, they learn about branches
3. They discover the `feature/dashboard-streamlit` branch
4. Attempt to merge ‚Üí **CONFLICT!**

**Learning Moments**:
- üìö **Understanding conflicts**: Same file, different changes
- ü§î **Decision making**: Which version is better? Or combine?
- üîç **Reading markers**: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Resolution**: Edit, remove markers, test
- ‚úÖ **Completion**: Stage, commit, push

---

## Student Exercise Flow

### Step 1: Discover the Branch
```bash
git branch -a
# See: remotes/origin/feature/dashboard-streamlit
```

### Step 2: View the Difference
```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate
# See branches have diverged
```

### Step 3: Attempt Merge
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/dashboard-streamlit
# CONFLICT!
```

### Step 4: See the Conflict
```bash
git status
# Shows: both modified: README.md
```

### Step 5: Resolve
Open README.md, see conflict markers, decide what to keep.

**Recommended Resolution**:
- Keep title from feature branch (more exciting)
- Combine project overview (mention both R and dashboard)
- Keep dashboard quick start (it's compelling)
- Combine exercises list (show levels but keep actual links)

### Step 6: Complete Merge
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "fix: merge dashboard feature into main

- Combined R workflow with dashboard features
- Kept dashboard quick start for engagement
- Merged exercise list with levels
- Resolved all conflicts by combining best of both"

git push origin main
```

---

## Pedagogical Benefits

### 1. **Real-World Conflict**
Not a contrived example - actual design decisions:
- Should we promote R or dashboards first?
- Traditional Git or modern visualization?
- Simple list or gamified levels?

### 2. **Multiple Valid Solutions**
No single "correct" answer:
- Could keep main version (simpler)
- Could keep feature version (flashier)
- Could combine (best of both)

Teaches judgment, not just mechanics!

### 3. **Meaningful Context**
Students care about the outcome:
- They've built these scripts
- They've seen the dashboard
- They understand both approaches
- Decision matters to them

### 4. **Complexity Levels**
- **Simple conflict**: Title (one line)
- **Medium conflict**: Project overview (paragraph)
- **Complex conflict**: Quick start (multiple sections)
- **Advanced conflict**: Exercises (structure change)

---

## Expected Outcomes

After resolving this conflict, students will:
- ‚úÖ Understand what causes merge conflicts
- ‚úÖ Know how to identify conflict markers
- ‚úÖ Be able to read both versions critically
- ‚úÖ Make informed decisions about what to keep
- ‚úÖ Complete a merge successfully
- ‚úÖ Feel confident about future conflicts

---

## Testing the Conflict

**Instructor should test**:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [repo-url]
cd git-practice

# Try the merge
git checkout main
git merge feature/dashboard-streamlit

# Should see:
# Auto-merging README.md
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

# Perfect! Conflict is set up correctly.
```

---

## Backup Plan

If students get stuck or panicked:

```bash
# Abort the merge
git merge --abort

# Everything returns to pre-merge state
# Can try again when ready
```

---

## Success Metrics

Students successfully resolved the conflict when:
- ‚úÖ README.md has no conflict markers (`<`, `=`, `>`)
- ‚úÖ README.md is syntactically valid Markdown
- ‚úÖ Merge commit exists in git log
- ‚úÖ Both branch histories are preserved
- ‚úÖ Repository is in clean state (`git status`)

---

## Additional Notes

### Why README.md?

- **Visible impact**: Changes are immediately obvious
- **Meaningful content**: Not just random text
- **Multiple sections**: Various complexity levels
- **Markdown format**: Easy to read and edit
- **Central file**: Students already familiar with it

### Why These Specific Changes?

- **Philosophical difference**: R-first vs dashboard-first
- **Structural difference**: Simple list vs leveled sections
- **Stylistic difference**: Professional vs gamified
- **Technical difference**: Different quick start flows

All create realistic scenarios where both versions have merit!
