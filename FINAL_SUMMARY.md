### 4. **Git Workflow Setup**
- ✅ `main` branch - Clean, stable version
- ✅ `feature/dashboard-streamlit` branch - **Intentional conflicts** for teaching
- ✅ Merge conflict exercise ready to use

### 5. **Security & Best Practices**
- ✅ `.gitignore` configured for Python, R, data science
- ✅ `.env` for API keys (excluded from Git)
- ✅ All scripts use `dotenv`:
  - R: `library(dotenv); load_dot_env()`
  - Python: `from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv()`
- ✅ INEGI token ready: `b51edd7a-4973-4cc1-b86a-5a2de96c06f4`

### 6. **Interactive Dashboard**
- ✅ Streamlit app (`dashboard_app.py`)
- ✅ Visualizes GDP, Inflation, Unemployment
- ✅ Interactive filters and KPIs
- ✅ Uses Plotly for professional charts
- ✅ Uses sample data from `data/` folders

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository (Instructor)

### Option 1: Direct Use
1. Fork this repository to your organization/account
2. Share fork with students
3. Students complete exercises 1-5 in order
4. Use as-is!

### Option 2: Customize
1. Fork and clone
2. Modify exercises for your course
3. Add your institution's data sources
4. Adjust INEGI token or use your own APIs
5. Push changes to your fork

### Teaching Merge Conflicts

**The main feature:** `feature/dashboard-streamlit` branch

When students run:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/dashboard-streamlit
```

They'll get **guaranteed conflicts** in README.md!

Perfect for teaching:
- How to identify conflicts
- Reading conflict markers
- Deciding what to keep
- Completing the merge

See [MERGE_CONFLICT_EXERCISE.md](MERGE_CONFLICT_EXERCISE.md) for step-by-step guide.

## 📊 Your Original R Scripts

### Kept & Enhanced

Your original scripts in `r/` are preserved:

**GDP Analysis:**
- `r/gdp/gdp.R` - ✅ Added `dotenv`
- `r/gdp/cycles.R`
- `r/gdp/gdppc_sexenios.R`
- `r/gdp/global_gdp.R`

**Inflation Analysis:**
- `r/inflation/inpc.R`
- `r/inflation/expectedinflation.R`
- `r/inflation/expectedinflation_long.R`
- `r/inflation/inpp.R`

**Labor Analysis:**
- `r/labor/labor-gap.R`
- `r/labor/labor-employment.R`
- `r/labor/labor-informality.R`
- `r/labor/labor-neet.R`

**Finance:**
- `r/finance/VaR.R`

**Theme:**
- `r/theme_skope.R` - Your custom ggplot theme!

### What Students Do With These

**Exercise 4** teaches students to:
1. Install required R packages
2. Run your GDP script
3. See real INEGI data fetched
4. View generated plots
5. Understand data → analysis → viz pipeline
6. Modify scripts (change dates, translations)
7. Create their own simple scripts

---

## 🔑 INEGI Token Setup

### For Students

In Exercise 2, students create `.env`:

```bash
# .env file (NOT committed to Git!)
INEGI_TOKEN=b51edd7a-4973-4cc1-b86a-5a2de96c06f4
INEGI_API=b51edd7a-4973-4cc1-b86a-5a2de96c06f4
```

Both variable names because:
- `INEGI_TOKEN` - Used in new example scripts
- `INEGI_API` - Used in your original R scripts

### Token Distribution

**⚠️ Important:** Don't put the real token in the repository!

**How to share it:**
1. Email to students
2. Announce in class
3. Canvas/LMS message
4. Printed handout

Students add it to their **local** `.env` file only.
