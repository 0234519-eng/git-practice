# Economic Observatory - Git & GitHub Practice Repository

Welcome to the Economic Observatory practice repository! This project teaches economics students how to use Git and GitHub while building a collaborative economic data analysis platform.

## Project Overview

This repository simulates a real-world economic observatory where students collaborate to:
- Collect and track economic indicators
- Analyze economic data using Python/R
- **Build interactive dashboards with Streamlit** âœ¨
- Generate reports and visualizations
- Share findings through collaborative workflows

### ðŸŽ¯ NEW: Interactive Dashboard Feature

This branch adds a powerful Streamlit dashboard for visualizing economic data:
- Real-time interactive charts (GDP, Inflation, Unemployment)
- Dynamic date range filters
- Professional Plotly visualizations
- Perfect for presentations and analysis

## Learning Objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will:
- Master Git fundamentals (fork, clone, commit, push, pull)
- Work with branches and feature development
- Handle merge conflicts professionally
- Collaborate using GitHub Pull Requests
- Apply version control to data analysis projects
- Document economic research using Markdown
- Manage data files and analysis scripts

- Add economic indicator data (CSV)
- Merge into main branch

### Phase 3: Analysis Scripts
**Skills**: Pull Requests, Code Review

- Write Python/R analysis scripts
- Create Pull Request
- Review teammate's code

### Phase 4: Report Writing
**Skills**: Merge Conflicts, Amend
